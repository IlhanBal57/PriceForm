I created a price quote form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When we first open the page, a blank page greets us. To add a product, we click the "+" button, and we are presented with four dropdown menus that change according to our selected options. After selecting our products, we click the 'Add' button to add them to our table. The application calculates the total price by multiplying the unit price by the quantity. After entering a few products, the bottom box shows the total price, summing up the general price of all products. Additionally, by clicking the 'Edit' button, we can instantly update incorrect data. The newly entered data replaces the old data in the table, and the old data is completely deleted![1](https://github.com/IlhanBal57/PriceForm/assets/167097961/45a897c2-1ee6-45f9-9690-ea6aa660c2de)
